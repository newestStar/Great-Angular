# Angular2 State Demo

Exploring State and Data management with @ngrx/store and http in an Angular2 demo

## Prerequisites
You will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js + NPM](http://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. 

You will also need to install the `typings` NPM package globally via `npm i -g typings`.

You will also need to install the `angular-cli` NPM package globally via `npm i -g angular-cli`.

## Make it go
This is a standard angular-cli generated application so you can use all of the ng XXX commands to manage the application.

```
# Download the code
$ git clone https://github.com/JavascriptMick/ng2-state-demo.git
$ cd ng2-state-demo

# Install dependencies
$ npm i

# Install typescript definitions
$ typings install

# Build the app
$ ng serve
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.
