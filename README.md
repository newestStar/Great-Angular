## Prerequisites
You will need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js + NPM](http://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. 

You will also need to install the `typings` NPM package globally via `npm i -g typings`.

You will also need to install the `angular-cli` NPM package globally via `npm i -g angular-cli`.

```
# Download the code
$ git clone https://github.com/tba.git
$ cd MYHACK5

# Install dependencies
$ npm i

# Install typescript definitions
$ typings install

# Build the app
